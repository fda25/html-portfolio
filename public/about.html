<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Nabilah Arabi. I currently work full-time as an executive and am also part-time studying to become a full stack web developer. I hold a diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and have been honored with a Dean's Award for my academic achievements.</p>

<p>I am passionate about technical challenges that stimulate my intellect without being overly theoretical. My recent fascination with programming has led me to embark on a journey to become a self-taught developer. Despite being new to this field, I am dedicated to learning and mastering the skills needed to excel as a full stack web developer.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy relaxing with my cat and exploring new programming concepts. I believe in the importance of continous learning and am exited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in my path to becoming a proficient developer.</p>
